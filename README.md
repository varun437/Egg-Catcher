<h1 align="center"> Catch-It </h1>

## Basic Info 

This is the traditional egg catching game made in Python. 
The user can make the basket move both sides using the arrow keys to collect as many eggs as he/she can which is the scoring factor but, he should avoid minions and bombs. 
There is also a provision to check out the highest score which is implemented using the files system.
